Problem 1: Sum of Even and Odd Numbers

Description:

Given an array of integers, your task is to find the sum of all even numbers and the sum of all odd numbers in the array.

Input:

An array nums of integers of length n.

Output:

Return a pair of values (sumEven, sumOdd) where:
sumEven is the sum of all even numbers in nums.
sumOdd is the sum of all odd numbers in nums.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: (6, 9)
Explanation: Sum of even numbers = 2 + 4 = 6, Sum of odd numbers = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.
